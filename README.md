# Set-AA5CoreSettings
AppAssure 5 required a number of settings configured after each installation, many of which were not available from within the UI. This is to be ran after installation of the Replay 5 core has been installed to fix many of those settings.

This PS1 needs to be ran as administrator, and will set all core settings necessary after installing the AppAssure 5 core software.
